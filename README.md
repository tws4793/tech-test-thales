# Thales Interview - Software Engineer (NPI)

This repository contains the response to the technical interview question.

## Question

To find all the pairs of two integers in an unsorted array that sum up to a given S. Write a program using any programming language. Please specify in comments inside your program the language used (Eg. Java, C++, C#, etc).

For example, if the array is `[5, 4, -3, 1, 2, 9]` and the sum is 6. Your program should return `[[5,1], [4,2], [-3,9]]` because $5+1=6$, $4+2=6$ and $-3+9=6$.
